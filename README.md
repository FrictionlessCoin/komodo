# The Komodo project

## Summary

This is the official git repository for the Komodo project.

Komodo is an open source visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the Teiid runtime framework. With Komodo, not only do you create source data models and map your sources to target formats using a visual tool, but you can also:

*	create a virtual database (or VDB) containing your models which you deploy to a Teiid instance and then access your data.
*	resolve semantic differences
*	create virtual data structures at a physical or logical level
*	use declarative interfaces to integrate, aggregate, and transform the data on its way from source to a target format which is compatible and optimized for consumption by your applications

You can use Komodo to integrate multiple sources, and access them using the common data access standards:

*	Web Services / SOAP / XML
*	JDBC / SQL
*	ODBC / SQL

Komodo represents the next generation of modelling tool for Teiid, building on the success of Teiid Designer.
